# Michigan

Are you between the ages of 6 and 12? Got grandmas? Michigan is the card game for you!

I remember playing for what felt like hours and hours, drinking chocolate milk, eating ice cream, and trying to steal all of grandmas' (one grandma, two great-grandmas) pennies.  

The game can be played with 3+ players, requires one deck of cards for actual play and the ace of hearts, king of clubs, queen of diamonds, and jack of spades pulled from another deck.  You'll need a bucket of pennies, pile of chips, a bag or M&Ms, whatever you wish to use for the ante.  It's known as a shedding game where the player's objective is empty their hand of all cards before any other players.
